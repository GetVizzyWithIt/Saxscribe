# Evaluation log

Every scorecard run, newest first. Protocol: [protocol.md](protocol.md).
Machine is Austin's M3 Pro MacBook unless noted. "Default" = torchcrepe full
for the contour, Basic Pitch for notes, Beat This! for beats.

## Summary: best result so far per set

| Set | Pitch | Onset F1 | Note F1 | Note F1 no offset | s/min | Targets | Run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bach10 | 96.9% | **92.2%** ✓ | **87.5%** ✓ | 92.2% | 21 | solo | E4 |
| choralebricks | **98.9%** ✓ | 86.7% | 77.8% | 86.5% | 22 | solo | E4 |
| urmp | 94.4% | 81.6% | 64.4% | 80.8% | 24 | solo | E3 |
| omnibook | 74% | **86%** ✓ | **64%** ✓ | — | — | mix | E6 |
| urmp-mix | 41.6% | 48.9% | 17.1% | 35.4% | 27 | mix | E3 |
| bach10-mix | 21.4% | 39.5% | 3.9% | 29.2% | 31 | mix | E4 |

Omnibook now uses chorus-limited grading (PR #16, E6); the earlier 45% note F1 (E2) was understated.

✓ = meets the v1 target for that set. Speed meets the full-mix target (60 s/min)
on every mix set and misses the solo target (15 s/min) on every solo set (21–24 s/min).

### E6 — 2026-11-02 — Omnibook re-graded inside each answer key's span (PR #16)
- **Settings**: default. 45 solos (one fewer than E2; reason to confirm from the scorecard).
- **Headline**: pitch 74%, onset F1 86% (mix target 75%: met), note F1 64% (mix target 60%: met).
- **What it shows**: E2's 45% came mostly from grading notes after the answer key ended. With fair grading the Omnibook stems meet the full-mix note targets; pitch accuracy (74% vs 90%) is now the gap, likely bleed in the separated stems.
- *To fill in*: commit, seconds per minute, note F1 without offsets, note-count ratio.

### E5 — 2026-11-02 — First real PDF render (finding, not a scorecard)
- **What happened**: one Omnibook stem rendered to a clean PDF in the right alto
  key, but with only 42 of 398 notes. On unaccompanied sax the beat tracker found
  almost no beats, and the notation step dropped notes it couldn't place on a grid.
- **Why it matters**: a fidelity bug (the tool must never omit notes). Scorecards
  didn't catch it because they grade Layer 3, not the notation.
- **Fix**: PR #15 (open), which also fixes a MuseScore crash on macOS.
- **Follow-up**: add a notation check to the scorecard: notes in the score ÷ notes in `notes.json` must be 1.

### E4 — 2026-11-02 — ChoraleBricks and Bach10 (PR #9)
- **Commit**: `489571e`. **Settings**: default, plus `segment` on choralebricks.

| Measure | choralebricks (38) | choralebricks, segment | bach10 (10) | bach10-mix (10) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pitch accuracy | 98.9% | 98.9% | 96.9% | 21.4% |
| Onset F1 | 86.7% | 74.1% | 92.2% | 39.5% |
| Note F1 | 77.8% | 60.3% | 87.5% | 3.9% |
| Note F1, no offsets | 86.5% | 73.9% | 92.2% | 29.2% |
| Seconds per minute | 22 | 20 | 21 | 31 |

- **What it shows**: pitch on clean sax is close to solved. Remaining solo
  losses are note boundaries: split repeated notes, and note ends (~9 points).
  Upper alto parts 86–96% note F1, inner alto parts 53–74%. The segmenter loses
  again. In the quartet the stem follows other instruments: 3–6× too many notes.

### E3 — 2026-11-02 — URMP (PR #8)
- **Commit**: `9abc06c`. **Settings**: default and `segment`; 11 sax parts.

| Measure | urmp | urmp, segment | urmp-mix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pitch accuracy | 94.4% | 94.5% | 41.6% |
| Onset F1 | 81.6% | 72.1% | 48.9% |
| Note F1 | 64.4% | 46.7% | 17.1% |
| Note F1, no offsets | 80.8% | 71.4% | 35.4% |
| Seconds per minute | 24 | 23 | 27 |

- **What it shows**: default writes 5–45% more notes than the key (held or
  tongued notes split). The segmenter helps on slow legato parts only.
  Mixes: 1.5–5× too many notes; on Rejouissance onsets land (71%) but pitch is
  5% (following trombone/tuba). 16_Surprise: 81% pitch under both tools.

### E2 — 2026-11-02 — Omnibook baseline (Phase 0 gate)
- **Commit**: main after PR #6 (`b1f9563`). **Settings**: default. 46 stems.

| Pitch accuracy | Onset F1 | Note F1 | Seconds per minute |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 73.3% | 60.4% | 45.0% | 44 |

- **What it shows**: Basic Pitch writes 1.5–3.2× the key's note count on these
  stems. Lower pitch accuracy than solo sets reflects bleed in the separated
  stems and the dataset's aligned-not-checked labels.

### E1 — 2026-11-02 — Omnibook smoke test
- **Settings**: default, `--limit 3`. Note F1 53%; Basic Pitch ~1.8× too many notes.
  Surfaced a fixture notation test failing only where Beat This! runs (fixed in PR #7).
